# Bulk File Renamer

This Python script allows you to bulk rename files in a directory by adding a prefix and an index number to each file's name.

2. Open the script and specify the directory path, prefix, and file extension in the `directory`, `prefix`, and `extension` variables respectively.
3. Run the script using Python: python bulk_rename.py
